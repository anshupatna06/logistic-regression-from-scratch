# Logistic Regression from Scratch 🧠

This project implements **Logistic Regression** from scratch using **NumPy**, without using any ML libraries like scikit-learn.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- ✅ Sigmoid function
- ✅ Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
- ✅ Gradient Descent Optimization
- ✅ Prediction & Accuracy Calculation
- ✅ Tested on the **Titanic Dataset**

## 📊 Dataset

- Dataset: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- Features used: `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Fare`

## 📈 Results

- Final Training Accuracy: ~80%
- Loss decreased with iterations (graph included in notebook)
