# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction — Logistic Regression from Scratch

This repository contains a custom implementation of **Logistic Regression** from scratch (without scikit-learn), applied to the Titanic dataset. It includes performance evaluation using various classification metrics.

"ML models implemented from scratch using NumPy and Pandas only"
# Logistic Regression from Scratch 🧠

This project implements **Logistic Regression** from scratch using **NumPy**, without using any ML libraries like scikit-learn.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- ✅ Sigmoid function
- ✅ Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
- ✅ Gradient Descent Optimization
- ✅ Prediction & Accuracy Calculation
- ✅ Tested on the **Titanic Dataset**

- ### 🧪 Evaluation Metrics Included:
- ✅ Confusion Matrix
- ✅ Precision
- ✅ Recall
- ✅ F1-Score
- ✅ ROC Curve
- ✅ AUC Score

- ## 📈 Evaluation Highlights (Sample Output)

| Metric            | Value       |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Accuracy          | 0.79        |
| Precision         | 0.84        |
| Recall            | 0.83        |
| F1-Score          | 0.83        |
| AUC Score         | 0.86        |

📊 ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix are visualized using Matplotlib.

## 📊 Dataset

- Dataset: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- Features used: `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Fare`

## 📈 Results

- Final Training Accuracy: ~80%
- Loss decreased with iterations (graph included in notebook)

- ## 🚧 Future Improvements

-More better contents with full "Explanation" and "Logic" behind using everything in the priject 
- Implementation of Mathematical Calculations "Manually" without using libraries like Scikit-Learn (from scratch)
- Feature importance visualization
- 
- Deployment with Streamlit
